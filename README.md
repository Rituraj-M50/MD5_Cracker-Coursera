# MD5_Cracker-Coursera

This application takes an MD5 hash of a four digit pin and check all 10,000 possible four digit pins to determine the pin. I did this project while learning Web Application with PHP Course on Coursera under Dr. Charles Severance, American computer scientist and academic who currently serves as Clinical Associate Professor of Information at the University of Michigan.
